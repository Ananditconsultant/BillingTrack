        <p>Each of the different payment gateways that are compatible with FusionInvoice are listed on the

        <h3>How do I get my PayPal REST API keys?</h3>

        <p>Prior to version 2018-7, FusionInvoice used PayPal's classic NVP/SOAP api. Version 2018-7 and later use
            PayPal's REST api.</p>

        <p>Log into the <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/">PayPal
                Developer</a> portal using your standard PayPal credentials.</p>

        <p>Click the Create App button in the REST API apps section of the My Apps & Credentials page.</p>
        <a href="/img/documentation/online_payments_paypal_rest1.png" target="_blank">
            <img src="/img/documentation/online_payments_paypal_rest1_small.png" class="img-responsive">
        </a>

        <p>Give the app a name, such as FusionInvoice (or whatever you'd like) and click the Create App button.</p>
        <a href="/img/documentation/online_payments_paypal_rest2.png" target="_blank">
            <img src="/img/documentation/online_payments_paypal_rest2_small.png" class="img-responsive">
        </a>

        <p>Once the app is created, the Client ID and Secret ID can be obtained. Note there is an option to switch
            between
            the keys for Sandbox and Live. Be sure and use Sandbox for testing purposes and Live for production. Also
            note the
            Secret ID spans two lines, so be sure the entire key gets copied. Configure the keys in FusionInvoice on the
            Online Payments
            tab in System Settings.</p>

        <h3>How does my client pay their invoice online?</h3>

        <p>Once you have FusionInvoice configured to accept online payments, clients may pay their invoices using the
            invoice public link.</p>
        <p>When an invoice is emailed to the client, the email will contain a link to view and pay the invoice online.
            This is the
            "invoice public link". Buttons for each of the enabled payment gateways will appear at the top of the
            invoice as shown below.</p>
