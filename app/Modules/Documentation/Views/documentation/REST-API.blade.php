            The FusionInvoiceFOSS API client library allows you to easily interact with clients, quotes, invoices and
            payments from
            your own code or software. It is available in the resources/misc directory of this repository and includes fully documented
            examples illustrating how to interact with your FusionInvoiceFOSS API.
